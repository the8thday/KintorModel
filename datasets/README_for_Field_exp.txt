Readme txt for the Dryad data package accompanying the manuscript "Experimental parasite community ecology: intraspecific variation in a large tapeworm affects community assembly".

The file "Field_exp.csv" contains the data from the study's field experiment. Each row corresponds to a fish and explanations of the columns are listed below.


Fish_ID: identifies fish individuals; a few fish could not be assigned to a treatment due to failed DNA matching and these are labeled "unassigned".

Schisto_exposure: whether fish were exposed (1) or not exposed (0) to the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus

Schisto_pop: whether fish were exposed to the German (low-growth, LG) or the Norwegian (high-growth, HG) population of S. solidus

Schisto_fam: which of the two tapeworm families within each population a fish was exposed to

Cage: codes which of the six cages fish were placed into in the lake. Each cage contained fish from a different full-sib family, and the coding here corresponds to the 'Fish_family' column in the lab experiment data file, i.e. family 1 in the lab experiment was the same fish family that was in cage 1.

Died_in_cage: fish either died (1) during the experiment or survived until the end (0).

Schisto_infection: fish infected (1) or not infected (0) with S. solidus

Plerocercoid_weight_mg: the weight in mg of the recovered plerocercoids of S. solidus

Treatment: the four treatment groups compared, which were (i) control fish not exposed to S. solidus, (ii) fish exposed to but not infected with S. solidus, and fish infected with S. solidus from either the (iii) LG or (iv) HG S. solidus populations.

Date_Schisto_exposure: date that fish were exposed to S.solidus

Date_in_lake: date that fish were placed into cages in the lake

Date_dissected: date that fish were dissected

Age_at_dissection: days between exposure and dissection

Fish_sex: whether experimental fish were male (M) or female (F)

Initial_total_length_mm: total fish length in mm at the time of exposure to S.solidus

Initial_std_length_mm: standard fish length (excludes caudal fin) in mm at the time of exposure to S.solidus

Initial_weight_g: fish weight in g at the time of exposure to S.solidus

Final_total_length_mm: total fish length in mm at the time of dissection

Final_std_length_mm: standard fish length (excludes caudal fin) in mm at the time of dissection

Final_weight_g: fish weight in g at the time dissection

Final_weight_no_Schisto: fish weight excluding the weight of S.solidus plerocercoids

HK_weight_mg: head kidney weight

Spleen_weight_mg: spleen weight

Liver_weight_mg: liver weight

Gonad_weight_mg: gonad weight

Irregular_Apatemon_Cysts: whether any metacercariae of the trematode Apatemon cobitidis appeared irregular and/or degraded (1 = yes, irregular, 0 = normal)



The remaining columns encode the parasite community. Each column is a separate parasite species, and the values represent counts, except for Trichodina, which was measured on an ordinal scale. For more information see Table S1.
