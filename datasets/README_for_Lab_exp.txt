Readme txt for the Dryad data package accompanying the manuscript "Experimental parasite community ecology: intraspecific variation in a large tapeworm affects community assembly".

The file "Lab_exp.csv" contains the data from the study's lab experiment. Each row corresponds to a fish and explanations of the columns are listed below.


Fish_ID: identifies fish individuals

Schisto_exposure: whether fish were exposed (1) or not exposed (0) to the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus

Fish_family: factor coding the six fish families used in the experiment; this corresponds to 'cage' in the field experiment data file, i.e. family 1 in the lab experiment was the same fish family that was in cage 1 in the field experiment.

Schisto_pop: whether fish were exposed to the German (low-growth, LG) or the Norwegian (high-growth, HG) population of S. solidus

Schisto_fam: which of the two tapeworm families within each population a fish was exposed to

Schisto_infection: fish infected (1) or not infected (0) with S. solidus

Plerocercoid_weight_mg: the weight in mg of the recovered plerocercoids of S. solidus

Treatment: the four treatment groups compared, which were (i) control fish not exposed to S. solidus, (ii) fish exposed to but not infected with S. solidus, and fish infected with S. solidus from either the (iii) LG or (iv) HG S. solidus populations.

Diplo_right_eye and Diplo_left_eye: the number of Diplostomum metacercariae in the right or left eyes of exposed fish

Diplo_intensity: the total number of Diplostomum metacercariae in each fish

Date_Schisto_exposure: date that fish were exposed to S.solidus

Date_dissected: date that fish were dissected

Age_at_dissection: days between exposure and dissection

Fish_sex: whether experimental fish were male (M) or female (F)

Initial_total_length_mm: total fish length in mm at the time of exposure to S.solidus

Initial_std_length_mm: standard fish length (excludes caudal fin) in mm at the time of exposure to S.solidus

Initial_weight_g: fish weight in g at the time of exposure to S.solidus

Final_total_length_mm: total fish length in mm at the time of dissection

Final_std_length_mm: standard fish length (excludes caudal fin) in mm at the time of dissection

Final_weight_g: fish weight in g at the time dissection

Final_weight_no_Schisto: fish weight excluding the weight of S.solidus plerocercoids

HK_weight_mg: head kidney weight

Spleen_weight_mg: spleen weight

Liver_weight_mg: liver weight
